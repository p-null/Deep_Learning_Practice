# Deep_Learning_Practice

The purpose of this repo is to re-implement the classic algorithm or model in the paper.

All the code are written in a well-commented way, following high-quality coding style.


# dependency
* pytorch 0.4

* python 3.7



# Models

* GAN

    a simple Generative adversarial network, run on MNIST

* ESIM

    [Enhanced LSTM for Natural Language Inference](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Enhanced-LSTM-for-Natural-Language-Inference-Chen-Zhu/83e7654d545fbbaaf2328df365a781fb67b841b4) by Chen et al., 2017.

* Capsule

    A linear Capsule network from 
    [Compositional coding capsule network with k-means routing for text classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09177)

# Usage

All the model haven been run successfully. 

There is enough information in the comment, so it is fairly easy to integrate this code with yours.
